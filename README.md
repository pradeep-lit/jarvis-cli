# Jarvis - A Virtual Assistant

Jarvis is a Python-based virtual assistant that listens for the wake word "Jarvis" and performs various tasks. It can interact with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate responses, search the web, and play audio.

## Features

- **Wake Word Activation**: Jarvis listens for the word "Jarvis" to activate.
- **Speech Recognition**: Converts voice commands to text using `speech_recognition`.
- **Web Search**: Opens the first result from a web search based on the command.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Uses `pyttsx3` and `gTTS` to provide voice responses.
- **GPT-3.5 Integration**: Generates AI-powered responses using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `speech_recognition`
  - `webbrowser`
  - `pyttsx3`
  - `gtts`
  - `pygame`
  - `requests`
  - `openai`
  - `googlesearch-python`
  - `youtube-search-python`

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(Create a `requirements.txt` file with the dependencies listed above.)*

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries as mentioned above.
3. Replace `<Your Key Here>` in the `client.py` file with your OpenAI API key.
4. Replace `<Your Key Here>` in the `main.py` file with your NewsAPI API key.
5. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

- **Voice Commands**: Simply say "Jarvis" followed by your command.
- **Examples**:
